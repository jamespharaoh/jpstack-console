@elem top-level/console-module

	This describes a console module. Each contains a number of builders which
	build up a configuration for that console module. These modules are then
	combined in phases to build up a working console.

	@attr name

		@required

		The name of this console module. This will normally match the name of an
		object type, in hyphenated form.

		This must be unique. No two console modules may share the same name, in
		the entire system.

	@children console-module-builder

@elem console-module-builder/console-helper-provider

	This provides extra information about an object type, which is required or
	useful only for the console.

	@attr object-name

		@required

		The name of the object type, in camel-case.

	@attr id-key

		The name under which this object's ID is stored in the context stuff.
		This is used when an object "borrows" its ID from another object, which
		normally is the case when there is a one-to-one mapping.

		If an object type uses a generated ID, this need not be specified, and
		it will default to the object name, in camel case, suffixed with "Id",
		for example: "objectNameId".
